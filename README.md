# GoodThingsFromGovt
A quick and dirty map to convey the importance of gov't health insurance to electeds in my area.

# What You'll Need

Most importantly, you'll need a Census Bureau API Key to be able to pull the ACS Data. You can get one of those here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html

This code won't run for you when you first try to run it, because of a few personal functions I've left in the code to give a better window into how I work.

These include:
  - Loading some personal functions I've written for exporting higher-quality visualizations
  - Loading Roboto for slightly prettier font on export

# What you can do:

- Tweak the code to pull census records from your own community, to underline how many of _your_ neighbors benefit from government health insurance.
- (If you know a little bit about the ACS) You can pull more data tables, finesse the title, and tell a unique story about how the government serves your community.
